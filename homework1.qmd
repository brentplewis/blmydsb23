# Data Manipulation

## Problem 1: Use logical operators to find flights that:

```         
-   Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (\> 120 minutes)
-   Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
-   Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
-   Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
-   Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
-   Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
```

```{r}
#| label: problem-1

# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (> 120 minutes)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(skimr)

delay_2_hr <- flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay>"120")

# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
houston_flights <- flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "HOU"| dest =="IAH")

houston_flights

# Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
UA_AA_DL_operated_flights <- flights %>% 
  filter(carrier=="UA"|carrier=="AA"|carrier=="DL")

UA_AA_DL_operated_flights

# Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
summer_flights <-flights %>% 
  filter(month=="7"|month=="8"|month=="9")
summer_flights
  
# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
two_hours_late <-flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay >120) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay <= 0)


# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
made_up_time <- flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay >= 60) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay-arr_delay>30)

made_up_time
```

## Problem 2: What months had the highest and lowest proportion of cancelled flights? Interpret any seasonal patterns. To determine if a flight was cancelled use the following code

<!-- -->

```         
flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) 
```

```{r}
#| label: problem-2

# What months had the highest and lowest % of cancelled flights?

# Total number of cancelled flights, summarised as a new column and saved as a new tibble
cancelled_flights<- flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(cancelled_flights_count = n())

cancelled_flights

# Total number of flights overall in dataset, summarised as a new column and saved as a new tibble
total_flights<- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(total_flights_count = n())

total_flights

# Proportion of total flights that are cancelled, calculated by left joining the cancelled_flights tibble to the total_flights tibble by the "month" variable (no issue with lost rows, since both tibbles have the same number of rows), creating a new "prop" variable to calculate the proportion of cancelled flights at each month and arranging from largest proportion to smallest

cancelled_flights_prop <-total_flights %>% 
  left_join(cancelled_flights, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate (prop = cancelled_flights_count / total_flights_count) %>% 
  arrange(desc(prop))

cancelled_flights_prop

# Intepretation: No months show especially high proportions of cancelled flights; February is the largest at 5%. We could infer that the higher proportions of cancelled flights towards the end of the calendar and academic/financial yeard are somehow related to travellers' changes of plans around holiday periods.
```

## Problem 3: What plane (specified by the `tailnum` variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please `left_join()` the resulting table with the table `planes` (also included in the `nycflights13` package).

For the plane with the greatest number of flights and that had more than 50 seats, please create a table where it flew to during 2013.

```{r}

skim(flights)

view(flights)
  
frequent_flyer<-flights %>% 
  filter(origin %in% c("LGA","JFK", "EWR")) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(tail_num_flights = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(tail_num_flights))
  
view(frequent_flyer)

planes_updated <-planes %>% 
  left_join(frequent_flyer, by = "tailnum") %>% 
  arrange(desc(tail_num_flights))

view(planes_updated)
```

## Problem 4: The `nycflights13` package includes a table (`weather`) that describes the weather during 2013. Use that table to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the distribution of temperature (`temp`) in July 2013? Identify any important outliers in terms of the `wind_speed` variable.
-   What is the relationship between `dewp` and `humid`?
-   What is the relationship between `precip` and `visib`?
```

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)

data(weather)  # Load the "weather" dataset

july_weather <- filter(weather, month == 7 & !is.na(wind_speed))  # Filter for July temperatures

  labs(x = "Precipitation", y = "Visibility") +
  ggtitle("Visibility tends to fall as precipitation rises, but the relationship is not strong") +
  theme_minimal()+
  ylim(0,NA)
```

## Problem 5: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```         
-   How many planes have a missing date of manufacture?
-   What are the five most common manufacturers?
-   Has the distribution of manufacturer changed over time as reflected by the airplanes flying from NYC in 2013? (Hint: you may need to use case_when() to recode the manufacturer name and collapse rare vendors into a category called Other.)
```

```{r}

view(flights)

planes %>% 
  filter(is.na(year)) %>% 
  count()

top_manufacturers <- planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  top_n(5, wt = count) %>%
  pull(manufacturer)

manufacturer_count <- planes %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  mutate(manufacturer=recode(manufacturer,"AIRBUS INDUSTRIE" = "AIRBUS","MCDONNELL DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT CO" = "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS","MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION" = "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS")) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

top_manufacturers <- top_n(manufacturer_count, 5, count)

library(lubridate)

flights_updated <- flights %>%
  mutate(day_of_year = yday(ymd(paste(year, month, day, sep = "-"))))

completed_flights<-flights_updated %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_time))

flights_with_manufacturers <-right_join(completed_flights,planes %>% 
                                         select(tailnum, manufacturer) %>% 
                                          mutate(manufacturer=recode(manufacturer,"AIRBUS INDUSTRIE" = "AIRBUS","MCDONNELL DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT CO" = "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS","MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION" = "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS")), by = "tailnum")

updated_flights_with_manufacturers <- flights_with_manufacturers %>%
  mutate(manufacturer = case_when(
    manufacturer %in% top_manufacturers$manufacturer ~ manufacturer,
    TRUE ~ "Other")) %>% 
  group_by(day_of_year,manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())

view(updated_flights_with_manufacturers)

ggplot(updated_flights_with_manufacturers, aes(x = day_of_year, y = count, fill = manufacturer, group = manufacturer)) +
  geom_area() +
  labs(x = "Time", y = "No. flights") +
  theme_minimal()


```

## Problem 6: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the oldest plane (specified by the tailnum variable) that flew from New York City airports in 2013?
-   How many airplanes that flew from New York City are included in the planes table?
```

```{r}

```

## Problem 7: Use the `nycflights13` to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the median arrival delay on a month-by-month basis in each airport?
-   For each airline, plot the median arrival delay for each month and origin airport.
```

```{r}

```

## Problem 8: Let's take a closer look at what carriers service the route to San Francisco International (SFO). Join the `flights` and `airlines` tables and count which airlines flew the most to SFO. Produce a new dataframe, `fly_into_sfo` that contains three variables: the `name` of the airline, e.g., `United Air Lines Inc.` not `UA`, the count (number) of times it flew to SFO, and the `percent` of the trips that that particular airline flew to SFO.

```{r}

```

And here is some bonus ggplot code to plot your dataframe

```{r}
#| label: ggplot-flights-toSFO
#| message: false
#| warning: false

fly_into_sfo %>% 
  
  # sort 'name' of airline by the numbers it times to flew to SFO
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, count)) %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  aes(x = count, 
      y = name) +
  
  # a simple bar/column plot
  geom_col() +
  
  # add labels, so each bar shows the % of total flights 
  geom_text(aes(label = percent),
             hjust = 1, 
             colour = "white", 
             size = 5)+
  
  # add labels to help our audience  
  labs(title="Which airline dominates the NYC to SFO route?", 
       subtitle = "as % of total flights in 2013",
       x= "Number of flights",
       y= NULL) +
  
  theme_minimal() + 
  
  # change the theme-- i just googled those , but you can use the ggThemeAssist add-in
  # https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggThemeAssist/index.html
  
  theme(#
    # so title is left-aligned
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    
    # text in axes appears larger        
    axis.text = element_text(size=12),
    
    # title text is bigger
    plot.title = element_text(size=18)
      ) +

  # add one final layer of NULL, so if you comment out any lines
  # you never end up with a hanging `+` that awaits another ggplot layer
  NULL
 
 
```

## Problem 9: Let's take a look at cancellations of flights to SFO. We create a new dataframe `cancellations` as follows

```{r}

cancellations <- flights %>% 
  
  # just filter for destination == 'SFO'
  filter(dest == 'SFO') %>% 
  
  # a cancelled flight is one with no `dep_time` 
  filter(is.na(dep_time))

```

I want you to think how we would organise our data manipulation to create the following plot. No need to write the code, just explain in words how you would go about it.

## Problem 10: On your own -- Hollywood Age Gap

The website <https://hollywoodagegap.com> is a record of *THE AGE DIFFERENCE IN YEARS BETWEEN MOVIE LOVE INTERESTS*. This is an informational site showing the age gap between movie love interests and the data follows certain rules:

-   The two (or more) actors play actual love interests (not just friends, coworkers, or some other non-romantic type of relationship)
-   The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old
-   No animated characters

The age gaps dataset includes "gender" columns, which always contain the values "man" or "woman". These values appear to indicate how the characters in each film identify and some of these values do not match how the actor identifies. We apologize if any characters are misgendered in the data!

The following is a data dictionary of the variables used

| variable            | class     | description                                                                                             |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:------------------------------------|
| movie_name          | character | Name of the film                                                                                        |
| release_year        | integer   | Release year                                                                                            |
| director            | character | Director of the film                                                                                    |
| age_difference      | integer   | Age difference between the characters in whole years                                                    |
| couple_number       | integer   | An identifier for the couple in case multiple couples are listed for this film                          |
| actor_1\_name       | character | The name of the older actor in this couple                                                              |
| actor_2\_name       | character | The name of the younger actor in this couple                                                            |
| character_1\_gender | character | The gender of the older character, as identified by the person who submitted the data for this couple   |
| character_2\_gender | character | The gender of the younger character, as identified by the person who submitted the data for this couple |
| actor_1\_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the older member of the couple                                                         |
| actor_2\_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the younger member of the couple                                                       |
| actor_1\_age        | integer   | The age of the older actor when the film was released                                                   |
| actor_2\_age        | integer   | The age of the younger actor when the film was released                                                 |

```

How would you explore this data set? Here are some ideas of tables/ graphs to help you with your analysis

-   How is `age_difference` distributed? What's the 'typical' `age_difference` in movies?

-   The `half plus seven\` rule. Large age disparities in relationships carry certain stigmas. One popular rule of thumb is the [half-your-age-plus-seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) rule. This rule states you should never date anyone under half your age plus seven, establishing a minimum boundary on whom one can date. In order for a dating relationship to be acceptable under this rule, your partner's age must be:

$$\frac{\text{Your age}}{2} + 7 \\\< \text{Partner Age} \\\< (\text{Your age} - 7) \\\* 2$$
How frequently does this rule apply in this dataset?

-   Which movie has the greatest number of love interests?
-   Which actors/ actresses have the greatest number of love interests in this dataset?
-   Is the mean/median age difference staying constant over the years (1935 - 2022)?
-   How frequently does Hollywood depict same-gender love interests?

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
